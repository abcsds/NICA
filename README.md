# Near Infrared spectroscopy Calculations and Analysis (NICA)

A MATLAB-based Graphical  User  Interface  (GUI)  to analysefunctional  Near-Infrared  Spectroscopy  (fNIRS) measurement data recorded with the NIRScoutdevice

## Installation

To install NICA you have to run the file `installNica.m`, which can be found in the main folder. The  installation  creates  the  folder  structure  for  all  the  necessary  functions  and  files  for  the GUI.  After  a  successful  installation  the  command  window  displays  the  message `Installation successful!`. Afterwards NICA can  be  started  at  any  time  (also  after restarting Matlab)  from  the  command window by simply typing the command `nica`.

## Usage Notes

NICA is freely available and can be edited and extended if necessary.
