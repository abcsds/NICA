% WRITE_FCDC_SPIKE writes spike timestamps and/or waveforms to a file
%
% Use as
%   write_fcdc_spike(filename, spike, ...)
%
% Additional options should be specified in key-value pairs and can be
%   'dataformat'    string, see below
%   'fsample'       sampling frequency of the waveforms
%
% The supported dataformats are
%   neuralynx_nse
%   neuralynx_nts
%   plexon_nex
%   matlab

% Revision 1.3  2007/03/21 17:25:54  roboos
% renamed neuralynx_nte to nts, since that is the correct extension
%
% Revision 1.2  2007/03/20 17:12:02  roboos
% added documentation
% implemented plexon_nex for spike waveforms
% moved scaling and conversion to int16 to low level function (for neuralynx)
% removed old pieces of code that was commented out
%
